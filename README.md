# ERML

_The EER diagram markup language_

## Introduction

ERML is a markup language for describing entity-relationship diagrams, **including IS-A (subclass) relationships**. It is built for **Chen's Notation**.\
Read `SPEC.md` for the full specification.

## Examples

Some examples are present in the examples folder.\
To generate the graphviz file, run `./erml.sh <filename>`. This will generate `graph.gv`, a graphviz file.\
The visualiser is WIP, but [Viz.js](https://viz-js.com/) works.
